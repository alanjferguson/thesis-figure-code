# PhD Project Code

Author: Alan J. Ferguson

This repository contains the code developed during my PhD.
The code is organised into directories as follows:
+ `./ajf_beam_model/` contains a one dimensional beam model with crack damage based on (Sinha et al. 2001).
+ `./ajf_plts/` contains some helper functions for making the plots and tables consistently.
+ `./chapter_N/` contains the code related to Chapter _N_ in my thesis.
+ `./thesis/` contains the LaTeX source for my thesis (it is a git submodule linking to a separate repo).
